The goal of pooling is to reduce the dimensionality of the input in-between two convolution layers to reduce the number of parameters in the network. For example, the famous LeNet CNN, uses max pooling with 2x2 filters and a stride of 2. Max pooling outputs the max value in a 2x2 region. This output is then the input of the next layer.\n",

        "\n",
        "For CNNs, convolution operations typically imply sparse connections. In other words, each filter only has a local receptive field. However, each successive layer will have access to a slightly larger receptive field. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at an example. Imagine a 3x3 filter with stride set to 1. In this case, the first layer's receptive field is a maximum of 3x3. However, the more layer we add the more we increase the network's receptive field. Adding a second layer with 3x3 filters and a stride of 1, our receptive field is increased to 5x5. Adding a third 3x3 layer further increases our receptive field to 7x7.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the advantage of using multiple smaller successive filters instead of a single larger one? A single large filter of 7x7 implies 49 parameters. Instead 3 layers of 3x3 filters requires only 27 parameters (9 \\* 3). It is therefore more efficient to use multiple successive filters and in both cases the receptive field is the same (7x7). In addition, by using multiple successive filters, we can introduce more non-linearities in the model (one after each filter).\n",

        "Object detection involves locating where an object is in a given image using a bounding box. The box as well as the object type are predicted by the neural network. In the case of object detection, the box is typically rectangle. While a rectangle is composed of 4 (x,y) coordinates, only 4 values are needed to reconstruct a box. For example, we could use the top right (x,y) coordinates as well as the width and height of the box. We can also use the minimum and maximum values that x and y can take: [`x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max`]. There can be many objects in an image, and object detectors should be able to detect all instances of various objects.\n",
