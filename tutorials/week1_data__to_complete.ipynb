By doing so, it is possible to augment the number of images in our training set artificially. For example, we can use flipping, cropping, and resizing to alter an image without modifying its associated label. As a result, we may observe some performance gains and better model generalization by learning to be invariant to these transformations. However, since data augmentation is creating artificially new examples from existing ones, the independence assumption is not fully respected. Thus, we should not use data augmentation for the validation and the test sets."
